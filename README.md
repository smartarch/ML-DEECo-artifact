# ML-DEECo artifact

This is an accompanying repository to the artifact paper *TODO* by *TODO*.

This repository features implementation of the `ml_deeco` framework as well as two examples of simulations implemented using the framework.

* [`ml_deeco`](ml_deeco) &ndash; a framework for implementation of simulations of adaptive distributed systems.
* [`smart_factory`](smart_factory) &ndash; simulation of a smart factory with adaptive security rules and machine-learning-based estimate of worker lateness.
* [`drone_charging_example`](drone_charging_example) &ndash; simulation of a smart farming system for protection of fields against birds using battery-powered flying drones.

* *TODO*: we need to be clear about the package installation and configurations
